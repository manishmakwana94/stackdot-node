# Institute Registration System - Node.js Project (MongoDB)

Overview
This project handles the registration process for various types of educational institutes. The system includes different workflows based on the institute type selected by the user. The registration involves selecting the institute type, board, class category, standards, subjects (for schools), university, degree type (for colleges), and competitive exam type (for exam centers). The project uses MongoDB for database storage, and the APIs will handle the entire registration process.
